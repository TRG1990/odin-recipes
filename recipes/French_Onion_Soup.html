    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The first step when preparing this classic French soup is to caramelize the onions. Depending on the type of onions and the amount of heat, this step can take as long as a few hours before the onions reach the right consistency and color. Liquid — usually water or beef broth — is added when the onions have been fully caramelized, and once everything is brought to a heavy boil, the heat is turned down, and the soup is left to simmer. The broth can be thickened with flour, either before or after adding the liquid. The finished soup is divided between individual crock pots, and dry bread or toasted croutons are placed on top. For the gratinated version, a copious amount of grated cheese — preferably Gruyère or Comté — is placed over the bread, and the entire dish is placed under the broiler, melting the cheese and giving it a beautiful golden crust.</p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>6oz (170g) butter</li>
        <li>8 large or 12 small onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2oz (60mL) port wine</li>
        <li>2oz (60mL) balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2qt (2L) dark chicken stock or low-sodium chicken or beef broth</li>
        <li>4oz (110g) slab bacon cut into 1/2" cubes</li>
        <li>1 bouquet garni</li>
        <li>16 baguette croutons, sliced and oven toasted with olive oil</li>
        <li>12oz (340g) grated Gruyère cheese</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Over medium heat, melt the butter in a large pan until it starts to brown.  Add in the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until brown and softened.</li>
        <li>Turn heat to medium-high and add the port wine and balsamic vinegar to the onions.  Scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze it and combine the ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Add the stock or broth, slab bacon, and bouquet garni and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat, season with salt and pepper, and let simmer for 45 minutes, skimming away any foam that forms on top.</li>
        <li>Remove the bouquet garni.</li>
        <li>Divide the soup into individual crock pots, cover surface with the toasted croutons, and cover with a generous amount of cheese.</li>
        <li>Place the crocks under a broiler or into the oven at 430°F (220°C) until the cheese melts and brown spots appear.</li>
      </ol>
